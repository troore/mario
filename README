This version is customized to fixed length messages which cannot exceed 56 bytes.

IMPLEMENTATION
1.mario
1)Cut the input into smaller chunks of which each can be fitted into the global memory. (Wei Xuechao) (Done)

OPTIMIZATION
1.mario
1)Auto tune the proper grid and thread-block scale. (Wei Xuechao) (Cancelled, shared memory cannot be allocated dynamically or dedicated by variable, thereby the dimensions of thread-block which are used to determine neede shared memory size can only sort to macros.)
2)Coalesce memory read/write when loading words from global memory to shared memory and storing hash values back to global memory after md5 processing. (Jiang Xia) (Done)
3)Put the 'k' and 'r' constant arrays into constant caches. (Done) (Cancelled, Rivest didn't use the constant array 'k' and 'r' like wiki algorithm.)
4)Overlap of memory copy and kernel execution between input chunks. (Wei Xuechao) (Cancelled, currently only kernel time is counted.)
5)Bank confict. (Jiang Xia) (Done)
